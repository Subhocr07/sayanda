                                            of this, mental capital should always be a society&#39;s first investment. We are all living in a super fast
                                            society where it is very easy to lose one ’s self. This lack of purpose affects young people in
                                            particular. They frequently discover that their souls are lacking the spiritual resources necessary to
                                            process suffering, frustration, disappointment, and sorrow when faced with the pain and
                                            uncertainties of life. In today’s times our exposure to the guiding forces of our Holy Texts, culture
                                            and spirituality are at the lowest that it has ever been.
                                            We wanted to find a way by which the young and the old could have easy and
                                            fast access to the teachings and guidance from our Holy Texts that encourage us to live life with
                                            purity, strength, discipline, honesty, kindness and integrity in order to find our purpose and to live it

                                            and known as the &quot;Song of God.&quot; The dialogue is structured in the form of a conversation between
                                            Prince Arjuna and Krishna, an avatar (incarnation) of the divinity Vishnu, and it takes up chapters 23
                                            to 40 of Book VI of the Mahabharata. It is often referred to as the Gita and was probably written in
                                            the first or second century CE.
